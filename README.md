Project name:- Real-Time Audio Waveform
Description:- 
This project is a real-time audio waveform visualizer written in Python. PyAudio gets sound from the microphone, while NumPy converts raw audio bytes to numerical samples that are then displayed as a live waveform by Pygame. While speaking or creating noise near the mic, this program instantly reads the audio, processes it, and draws a smooth line across the screen, showing the changing sound waves. This program also calculates the loudness in the audio using RMS and displays the level in decibels.
The inspiration to actually make this project came when, while watching the Australia vs India cricket match, we saw the LBW umpire review showing a live ball-tracking waveform and sound spike during the UltraEdge or Snicko test. That view motivated us to create a similar real-time waveform visual effect using Python. Using PyAudio for audio capture, NumPy for signal processing, and Pygame for visualization, it was possible to make our own simplified version of that real-time audio tracking system.
